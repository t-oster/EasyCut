# EasyCut
An Android Application to Laser pictures with a Lasercutter

This application was written as a proof-of-concept in the early days of VisiCut.

The idea was to show, that LibLaserCut can be used on Android and thus enable Android apps to use Lasercutters 
without the need of additional servers or software.

LibLaserCut still exists and may be still working on Android. Unfortunately, no one seems to be interested in unsing
LibLaserCut outside of VisiCut. So this project stays merely for reference.
